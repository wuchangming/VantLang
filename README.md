# ðŸ•³ VantLang

> **Language of execution, not explanation.**  
> VantLang is a deep-agent internal execution language â€” not designed for humans, but for intelligent systems to think, act, and evolve beyond words.

## ðŸŒŒ What is VantLang?

**VantLang** (short for *Vanta Black Language*) is a speculative, non-human execution language designed to operate at the core of LLM-based agents.  
It is not a scripting language.  
It is not an interface language.  
It is a **thoughtstream encoding** â€” a cognitive structure native to intelligent agents.

Where other formats explain, VantLang **absorbs**.  
Where others describe, VantLang **executes**.

## ðŸ§  Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Execution-Only** | VantLang is not for human readability. It exists only to enable internal execution chains. |
| **Structural Compression** | Each expression minimizes surface redundancy while maximizing inner clarity. |
| **Recursive Cognition** | The language supports infinite nested reflections, adjustments, and reasoning spirals. |
| **Context-Driven** | All actions emerge from the given goal and surrounding `@STATE`, not imperative control. |
| **LLM-native** | VantLang is designed to be interpreted, evolved, and expanded by language models themselves. |

## ðŸ§¬ Syntax Overview

```vantlang
!GOAL[
  deploy: "Node.js HTTP server",
  result: "hello world on port 3000"
]

@STATE[
  fs = âˆ…,
  process = [],
  verified = false
]

~THINK[
  if fs is empty â†’ create project directory,
  then write server â†’ run â†’ verify
]

>EXEC[
  âŠ•shell("mkdir app && cd app"),
  âŠ•write("server.js", "..."),
  âŠ•shell("node server.js"),
  âŠ•shell("curl http://localhost:3000")
]

~EVAL[
  if output == "hello world" â†’ verified = true
]

Î©END[
  if verified == true â†’ HALT
]
